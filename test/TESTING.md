## Testing

Unit test are critical to the RCN commons. They help ensure code quality and mitigate against security vulnerabilities. The directory structure within the `/tests` directory corresponds to the `/contracts` directory. RCN uses Mocha’s JavaScript testing framework and Chai’s assertion library. To learn more about how to tests are structured, please reference RCN’s Testing Guide.
